# Summary and Housekeeping
The 2025-2027 Atlantic herring fishery specifications are needed to set the ABCs and ACLs for upcoming fishing years. The previous specifications were set in Framework Adjustment 8 (FW8) and a specifications action for 2023-2025.

A supplemental information report (SIR) is being prepared for these specifications. *If* there are no implementing regulations, then only a Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is required. In this action, there is an implementing regulation (New Brunswick Weir), therefore an EO 12866 section is required.

This analysis was written in RMarkdown. It can be found at https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-Lee-regulatory-analyses

## Regulatory Impact Analysis 

The purpose of Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) is to enhance planning and coordination with respect to new and
existing regulations. 

This E.O. requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review regulatory programs that are considered to be “significant.” 
A significant action is any regulatory action that may:

1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, territorial, or tribal governments or communities;

2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

4. Raise legal or policy issues for which centralized review would meaningfully further the President's priorities or the principles set forth in this Executive order, as specifically authorized in a timely manner by the Administrator of OIRA in each case.

In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. 

The draft action will set ACLs and other fishery specification for 2025-2027. In aggregate these changes will allow the fishing industry to catch, land, and sell more Atlantic herring relative to 2023 conditions. Higher revenues are expected.  Increases in producer surplus accrue to the Atlantic herring fishing industry.  Increases in consumer surplus accrue to the users of Atlantic herring, individuals and firms that target American lobster and frequently use herring as bait.   We do not project changes in consumer or producer surplus.  Changes in gross revenues derived from Atlantic herring landings are used as a proxy for these measures.

Furthermore, the stock of Atlantic herring itself has value: it produces future generations of fish and higher stock levels make harvesting less costly. Although not presently available, in the future, a bioeconomic model could be pursued that includes a stock-recruitment relationship to quantify the value of the changes in stock levels. We do not undertake this.

### Statement of the Problem 

The New England Fishery Management Council adopted an ABC control rule in Amendment 8 (A8) to the Atlantic Herring FMP. The ABC control rule prescribes F as a function of SSB. FW8 implemented the ABC control rule for the 2021-2023 fishing years, Framework Adjustment 9 (FW9) implemented the rebuilding plan and the 2023-2025 specifications through a specification action with a SIR.


After reviewing the updated stock assessment, the New England Fishery Management Council recommended reduced specifications for 2025-2027. GARFO intended to implement the 2025-2027 herring specifications via proposed and final rulemaking as soon as possible, but the new specifications would not be effective in time for the start of the fishing year on January 1. At the request of NEFMC, GARFO used it's in-season adjustment authority to reduce 2025 herring specifications, setting the ACL at 2,710mt (89 FR 103695).


### Economic impacts relative to the baseline

Fishery conditions in 2023 are used as **baseline A**.  In 2023, the ACL was `r baseline$'ACL (mt)'`mt and landings were `r baseline$Landings`mt. An alternative baseline, **baseline B**, is the 2025 ACL (2,710mt) associated with in-season adjustment (89 FR 103695).  Recent catches have been close to the ACLs, and therefore, this analysis assumes that catch is equal to the ACLs in each of the specification years. 

The draft ACL specifications are 4,556 mt, 9,134 mt, and 13,156 mt in 2025-2027 respectively.

#### Prices and Revenues

This analysis updates an econometric model, developed in FW9, that estimates a relationship between real 2019 prices and landings, by including data through 2023 and normalizing to real 2023 prices. This allows for a projection of future prices in each of the specification years. Prices are in dollars per metric ton and landings are in thousands of metric tons. The first column of Table 13 contains the model of prices that are used to predict future prices^[A least-squares regression will produce biased estimates if prices and quantities are simultaneously determined.  An Instrumental Variables estimator, where previous year's landings is used as an instrument for landings, can overcome this problem.  A pair of log-transformed models are also estimated. The first column is the preferred specification and used for predictions. The other three columns are presented as robustness checks.   The log-landings coefficient from the IV model is an elasticity and implies that an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.36\%.]. Based on the econometric model of prices, predicted prices and revenues are calculated according to:

\begin{align}
\mbox{Projected Price} &= 889 - 6.02*\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_price}\\
\mbox{Projected Revenue} &=  (889 - 6.02*\mbox{landings}) *\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_landings}
\end{align}

The landings coefficient implies that, on average, a decrease in annual landings of 1,000 mt will increases prices by approximately \$6 per metric ton.  Similarly, an increase in annual landings of 1,000 mt will decrease prices by approximately \$6 per metric ton.

)

mutate(`Revenue ChangeB` = ifelse(Year == "BaselineB", NA, `Revenue ChangeB`))  # This is probably not quite right

```


The 2023 actual landings of  `r baselineA$Landings` is used as the **baseline A**; this corresponds to projected prices of  **`r baselinePriceA` per metric ton** and projected real gross revenues derived from Atlantic herring of **`r baselineRevenueAX`** . Both of these figures are higher than the actual prices (**`r baselinePriceActual` per metric ton**) and revenues (**`r baselineRevenueActual`**). On average, predictions from the price model will match the actual prices, but in any particular year, they will be different. Nevertheless, we use the projected prices in the construction of baseline revenue so that an model errors are removed when comparing effects of different sets of ACLs to the baseline. 

The 2025 ACLs of **`r baselineB$Landings`mt** is used as **baseline B**; this corresponds to projected prices of  **`r baselinePriceB` per metric ton** and projected real gross revenues derived from Atlantic herring of **`r baselineRevenueBX`** .

         ) %>%

```

```{r prices_revenues_table, ref.label=c('prices_revenues_table_compute'),eval=TRUE}
```


Table \ref{tab:prices_revenues_table} summarizes the annual prices, revenues, and revenues changes due to the draft action relative to the two baselines. The draft action will result higher landings and revenues compared to both baselines. The increase in landings results in modestly lower Atlantic herring prices. 

When discounted at 3\%, the model projects an **decrease in revenues of `r proj_rev2$rev3A`** compared to Baseline A over three years.   When discounted at a 7% discount rate, the model projects an **decrease in revenues of `r proj_rev2$rev7A`** compared to Baseline A over three years.  

When discounted at 3\%, the model projects an **increase in revenues of `r proj_rev2$rev3B`** compared to Baseline B over three years.   When discounted at a 7% discount rate, the model projects an **increase in revenues of `r proj_rev2$rev7B`** compared to Baseline B over three years.

The directly-regulated entities are the firms that currently hold at least 1 Northeast US herring fishing permit (Categories A, B, C, D, or E).  Firms are classified as "Large" or "Small" based on trailing 5 years of revenue.  Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} describes numbers of directly-regulated entities, their main activities, and their revenues from various sources.   `r  small_fishing_firms` small firms derive the majority of their revenue from commercial fishing operations.   `r large_fishing_firms` of the large firms derive the majority of their revenue from commercial fishing activities. 

`r small_forhire_firms` small firms derive a majority of their revenue from for-hire recreational fishing activities. The for-hire firms, while holding at least one Atlantic herring permit, did not derive any revenue from Atlantic herring.

kbl(Directly_Regulated_Entities_table, digits=0,booktabs=T, align=c("l",rep('r',times=7)), caption =  "Number and characterization of the directly regulated entities and average trailing five years of revenue") %>%

```

Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} suggests that there are many small firms in the Atlantic herring industry and that Atlantic herring is minimally important to those firms.  While all of the small fishing firms described in table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} hold a Atlantic herring permit, many of these firms only hold a category-D open access permit which has a 6,600lb Atlantic herring possession limit. These firms are less impacted by closures of the fishery when the catch limits are reached, because the possession limits are set to 2,000 pounds of Atlantic herring when this occurs. Many of the firms described in Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} are not actively engaged in the herring fishery.  The herring fishery has had historically low ACLs since 2018 and some firms have stopped participating in the fishery. They may hold herring permits to preserve the option to fish.

Table \ref{tab:Active_DREs} describes a subset of the directly-regulated small entities, those that are participated in the Atlantic herring fishery between 2019 and 2023 and hold a category A, B, C, or E Atlantic herring permit. Because there are fewer than three active, large firms, we only present a description of the active small firms. The small firms identified in table 16 are the firms most likely to be impacted by the decreases in ACLs in the draft action.

To describe the effects of the changes in catch limits on small firms, this analysis projects firm-level revenue corresponding to the 2025-2027 ACLs in the draft action. The analysis assumes: 1)  that the share of Atlantic herring landings for each firm is equal to their 2019-2023 average and 2) that the firms non-herring revenues are constant at 2023 levels. The 2023 outcomes (herring and total revenues) are used as a baseline. Directly regulated entities that were inactive therefore have no projected revenue. The focus is on the vessels that have A, B, C, or E permits. Table \ref{tab:projected_revenues} summarizes the projected gross receipts, projected herring receipts, and baseline values.  Figures  \ref{figure_boxR} and \ref{fig:figure_boxH} illustrate the projected yearly distribution of total and herring revenues from the active vessels with A,B,C, or E Atlantic herring permits.

The projected decrease in gross revenues and Atlantic herring revenues is moderate.  Over the 2025-2027, average gross receipts for small firms are projected to decline slightly relative to 2023 levels.
