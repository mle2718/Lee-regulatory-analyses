# Summary and Housekeeping
The 2025-2027 Atlantic herring fishery specifications are needed to set the ABCs, ACLs, and other specifications. This is an application of the ABC control rule established with Amendment 8. The previous specifications were set in Framework Adjustment 8 (FW8) and a specifications action for 2023-2025.

A supplemental information report (SIR) is being prepared for these specifications. *If* there are no implementing regulations, then only a Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is required. In this action, there is an implementing regulation (New Brunswick Weir), therefore an EO 12866 section is required.

This analysis was written in RMarkdown. It can be found at https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-Lee-herring-analyses

## Regulatory Impact Analysis 

The purpose of Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended by E.O. 14094 (88 FR 21879, April 6, 2023) is to enhance planning and coordination with respect to new and
existing regulations. 
This E.O. requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review regulatory programs that are considered to be “significant.” 
A significant action is any regulatory action that may:

1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more (adjusted every 3 years by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)  for changes in gross domestic product); or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, territorial, or tribal governments or communities;

2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

4. Raise legal or policy issues for which centralized review would meaningfully further the President's priorities or the principles set forth in this Executive order, as specifically authorized in a timely manner by the Administrator of OIRA in each case.

In deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential to consider. 

The draft action will set ACLs and other fishery specification for 2025-2027. In aggregate these changes will allow the fishing industry to catch, land, and sell less Atlantic herring. Lower revenues are expected.  Decreases in producer surplus accrue to the Atlantic herring fishing industry.  Decreases in consumer surplus accrue to the users of Atlantic herring, individuals and firms that target American lobster and frequently use herring as bait.   We do not project changes in consumer or producer surplus.  Changes in gross revenues derived from Atlantic herring landings are used as a proxy for these measures.

The rebuilding plan sets lower ABCs, and therefore lower ACLs, in order to rebuild the overfished stock of Atlantic herring to a biomass that can sustain MSY. Furthermore, the stock of Atlantic herring itself has value: it produces future generations of fish and higher stock levels make harvesting less costly. Although not presently available, in the future, a bioeconomic model could be pursued that includes a stock-recruitment relationship to quantify the value of the changes in stock levels. We do not undertake this.

### Management Goals and Objectives

\textcolor{red}{By reference}

### Description of the Fishery and other affected entitites

See Sections 3 and 4 for a description of the fishery

### Statement of the Problem 

The New England Fishery Management Council adopted an ABC control rule in Amendment 8 (A8) to the Atlantic Herring FMP. The ABC control rule prescribes F as a function of SSB. FW8 implemented the ABC control rule for the 2021-2023 fishing years, Framework Adjustment 9 (FW9) implemented the rebuilding plan and the 2023-2025 specifications through a specification action with a SIR.


### Economic impacts relative to the baseline

Previous specifications set the 2025 ACL at 23,961mt; this value is used as a baseline. The specifications recommended by the Herring Committee for are 2,710 mt, 6,854 mt, and 6,854 mt in 2025-2027 respectively.  The ABC control rule would set ACLs of 2,710 mt, 6,854 mt, and 11,404 mt in 2025-2027 respectively.  Recent catches have been close to the ACLs, and therefore, this analysis assumes that catch is equal to the ACLs in each of the specification years. This assumption seems reasonable since the draft ACLs are well below recent values.

#### Prices and Revenues

This analysis updates an econometric model, developed in FW9, that estimates a relationship between real 2019 prices and landings, by including additional  years of data and normalizing to real 2023 prices. This allows for a projection of future prices in each of the specification years. Prices are in dollars per metric ton and landings are in thousands of metric tons. The first column of Table 13 contains the model of prices that are used to predict future prices^[A least-squares regression will produce biased estimates if prices and quantities are simultaneously determined.  An Instrumental Variables estimator, where previous year's landings is used as an instrument for landings, can overcome this problem.  A pair of log-transformed models are also estimated. The first column is the preferred specification and used for predictions. The other three columns are presented as robustness checks.   The log-landings coefficient from the IV model is an elasticity and implies that an increase in landings of 1\% will reduce prices by 0.36\%.]. Based on the econometric model of prices, predicted prices and revenues are calculated according to:

\begin{align}
\mbox{Predicted Price} &= 894 - 6.079*\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_price}\\
\mbox{Predicted Revenue} &=  (894 - 6.079*\mbox{landings}) *\mbox{landings}\label{eq:predicted_landings}
\end{align}

The landings coefficient implies that, on average, an decrease in annual landings of 1,000 mt will increases prices by approximately \$6 per metric ton.  Similarly, an increase in annual landings of 1,000 mt will decrease prices by approximately \$6 per metric ton.

\end{table}

#### Baseline Description

The previous specifications included an ACL for 2025 set at 23,961mt. This is a reasonable baseline against which to evaluate the economic effects of the draft action. Under the baseline, the model projects prices of  **\$748/metric ton** and real gross revenues derived from Atlantic herring of **\$17.9M**.

      row_spec(0,bold=FALSE) 
```



```{r npv, eval=TRUE}
# Compute NPV of change in revenue at the 3% and 7% discount rates. No table is made here. I'm just computing a pair on numbers and sticking it into the text.

  mutate(across(c(rev2, rev7, rc), ~ number(.x, accuracy=1000,prefix="$", big.mark=",")))

```

Table \ref{tab:prices_revenues} summarizes the annual prices, revenues, and changes of the draft action relative to the baseline. The draft action will result substantially lower landings relative to the baseline. The decrease in landings results in modestly higher Atlantic herring prices. Overall, the model projects a **decrease in revenues of `r proj_rev2$rc`** over the 2025-2027 time period. When discounted at a 2% discount rate, this corresponds to a net present value **decrease of `r  proj_rev2$rev2`**.

```

Table \ref{tab:prices_revenuesCR} summarizes the annual prices, revenues, and changes of the ABC Control rule ACLs relative to the baseline. These ACLs will result substantially lower landings relative to the baseline.  The decrease in landings results in modestly higher Atlantic herring prices. Overall, the model projects a **decrease in revenues of `r proj_revCR2$rc`** over the 2025-2027 time period. When discounted at a 2% discount rate, this corresponds to a net present value **decrease of `r  proj_revCR2$rev2`**.

Relative to the draft action, the specifications associated with the ABC control rule have higher landings and revenues in 2027.  Because the Atlantic herring ACL is higher in 2027, this is less likely to rebuild the overfished Atlantic herring stock.

```

The directly-regulated entities are the firms that currently hold at least 1 Northeast US herring fishing permit (Categories A, B, C, D, or E).  Firms are classified as "Large" or "Small" based on trailing 5 years of revenue.  Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} describes numbers of directly-regulated entities, their main activities, and their revenues from various sources.   `r  small_fishing_firms` small firms derive the majority of their revenue from commercial fishing operations.   `r large_fishing_firms` of the large firms derive the majority of their revenue from commercial fishing activities. 

`r small_forhire_firms` small firms derive a majority of their revenue from for-hire recreational fishing activities. The for-hire firms, while holding at least one Atlantic herring permit, did not derive any revenue from Atlantic herring.

```{r make_DRE_table} 
kbl(Directly_Regulated_Entities_table, digits=0,booktabs=T, align=c("l",rep('r',times=7)), caption =  "Number and characterization of the directly regulated entities and average trailing five years of revenue") %>%
    #column_spec(5:8, width = "2cm")
    kable_styling(full_width = T,latex_options = "hold_position") %>% 
      row_spec(0,bold=FALSE) 
```

Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} suggests that there are many small firms in the Atlantic herring industry and that Atlantic herring is minimally important to those firms.  While all of the small fishing firms described in table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} hold a Atlantic herring permit, many of these firms only hold a category-D open access permit which has a 6,600lb Atlantic herring possession limit. These firms are less impacted by closures of the fishery when the catch limits are reached, because the possession limits are set to 2,000 pounds of Atlantic herring when this occurs. Many of the firms described in Table \ref{tab:make_DRE_table} are not actively engaged in the herring fishery.  The herring fishery has had historically low ACLs since 2018 and some firms have stopped participating in the fishery. They may hold herring permits to preserve the option to fish.

Table \ref{tab:Active_DREs} describes a subset of the directly-regulated small entities, those that are participated in the Atlantic herring fishery between 2019 and 2023 and hold a category A, B, C, or E Atlantic herring permit. Because there are fewer than three active, large firms, we only present a description of the active small firms. The small firms identified in table 16 are the firms most likely to be impacted by the decreases in ACLs in the draft action.

To describe the effects of the changes in catch limits on small firms, this analysis projects firm-level revenue corresponding to the 2025-2027 ACLs in the draft action. The analysis assumes: 1)  that the share of Atlantic herring landings for each firm is equal to their 2019-2023 average and 2) that the firms non-herring revenues are constant. Directly regulated entities that were inactive therefore have no projected revenue. The focus is on the vessels that have A, B, C, or E permits. Table \ref{tab:projected_revenues} summarizes the projected gross receipts, projected herring receipts, and baseline values.  Figures  \ref{figure_boxR} and \ref{fig:figure_boxH} illustrate the projected yearly distribution of total and herring revenues from the active vessels with A,B,C, or E Atlantic herring permits.

The projected decrease in gross revenues and Atlantic herring revenues is substantial. In 2025, average gross receipts are projected to fall by over 22% and Atlantic herring receipts are projected to fall by over 86%. Firms are likely to exit the Atlantic herring fishery, although this exit may be temporary if stock levels and ACLs increase quickly. The next management track stock assessment is in 2026. Results from that assessment would inform development of the 2027-2029 specifications, and therefore 2027 ACL is likely to be revised based on this stock assessment.
